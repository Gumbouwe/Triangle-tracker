In this application if you enter the length of side 1 and the length of side 2 it checks if they are equal and you enter the side 3 also is equal to other, it tells you it is Equirateral.
if it finds that any two sides are equal it tells you it is Isosceles triangle.else if it finds that no side is equal to other and the sum of any two sides is greather than the third side , it tells you its Scalene triangle.else if the sum of any two sides is less than or equal to the third side , it tells you that it is not a definite triangle.
